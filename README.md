# NAME : QUIZ TIME APP ![Image of QuizTimeApp](https://github.com/alu-rwa-prog-1/week-2-class-activity-1-edkizu/blob/main/QuizTime%20FInal/images/quiztimelogo.png)

# PURPOSE OF THE APP

We thought the App would be a great source of entertainment and competition  for the main reason that we have participated in a lot of Kahoot challenges in school so we challenged ourselves to make something similar for us to see how well we could do it.
